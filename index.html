												<h2>SURJ Colorado Springs Mission Statement</h2>
											</header>											
											
											<p>SURJ Colorado Springs honors SURJ National's core 
											principles of calling in more white people to be 
											accomplices in the fight for racial justice and holding 
											white people accountable and responsible for dismantling 
											white supremacy and breaking down systems of oppression. 
											Simultaneously, SURJ COS has been a multiracial space 
											since its inception and we want to further embrace and 
											center our community. ALL are welcome that are wanting 
											to show up for racial justice. At its core, SURJ is 
											accountable to people of color (POC)-led activism, 
											initiatives, and calls-to-action and we will maintain this format.</p>

												<h3>Pay Your Teachers:  How to Compensate Black Women and Femmes on Social Media for Their Emotional Labor</h3>
											</header>
											<p>"White people believe slavery ended over 150 years ago. Black people know better. 
											Slavery has merely evolved into more insidious (albeit socially acceptable) oppression. 
											What definitely hasn’t changed? Black women today still aren’t being paid for much of 
											their work." 
											<a href="https://medium.com/@SolidarityWOC/pay-your-teachers-763d574c7d7f">Read on</a> 
											for more on this topic and ways to use your privilege to 
											support people of color, especially Black women and femmes on social media.</p>

												<h3> Share Reflections</h3>												
											</header>
											<p>
											Thanks for being with us on this sometimes rocky, always challenging journey in the struggle for 
											racial justice. Encouraged by the start of the new year, we are stepping back and looking at the 
											past year and a half with an eye towards the big questions, and would love to hear your perspective 
											also. With that long-term view in mind, here are the questions we are pondering:</br>
											What have you taken away from the events and community meetings that SURJ has sponsored or hosted?</br>
											What are the current most pressing needs of the community?</br>
											In addition, if you have other thoughts about our activities, mission, and the community, we encourage 
											you to share them with us at cossurj@gmail.com. Thanks! </p>
