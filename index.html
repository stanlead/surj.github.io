												<h3>SURJ Colorado Springs Mission Statement</h3>
											</header>											
											
											<p>SURJ Colorado Springs honors SURJ National's core 
											principles of calling in more white people to be 
											accomplices in the fight for racial justice and holding 
											white people accountable and responsible for dismantling 
											white supremacy and breaking down systems of oppression. 
											Simultaneously, SURJ COS has been a multiracial space 
											since its inception and we want to further embrace and 
											center our community. ALL are welcome that are wanting 
											to show up for racial justice. At its core, SURJ is 
											accountable to people of color (POC)-led activism, 
											initiatives, and calls-to-action and we will maintain this format.</p>
