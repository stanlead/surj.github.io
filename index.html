												<h2>SURJ Colorado Springs Mission Statement</h2>
											</header>											
											
											<p>SURJ Colorado Springs honors SURJ National's core 
											principles of calling in more white people to be 
											accomplices in the fight for racial justice and holding 
											white people accountable and responsible for dismantling 
											white supremacy and breaking down systems of oppression. 
											Simultaneously, SURJ COS has been a multiracial space 
											since its inception and we want to further embrace and 
											center our community. ALL are welcome that are wanting 
											to show up for racial justice. At its core, SURJ is 
											accountable to people of color (POC)-led activism, 
											initiatives, and calls-to-action and we will maintain this format.</p>

												<h3>Me, Too:  The Womxn's March on Colorado Springs</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Join locally in solidarity with national and international Women’s Marches! 
											Last year we made history with the largest march held in the city. This year, 
											local organizers invite you to again show up to affirm our commitment to work 
											together to lift up the individuals and collective identities in our community 
											who continue to be disproportionately marginalized and targeted for acts of violence. </br>
											Members of marginalized communities are also victims of gun violence, and out of 
											respect for those in attendance at the March who have experienced gun trauma, 
											we are requesting no open-carrying of weapons, hateful or violent actions. </br>
											This year’s march “Me, Too: The Womxn’s March on Colorado Springs” recognizes 
											the violence that such populations, especially transwomxn of color, experience 
											in our society. We honor Tarana Burke, founder of the “Me, too” movement and 
											other womxn of color who continue to inspire resilience and an ethic of confronting injustice. </br>
											Gathering in Acacia Park will begin at 2p.m., and speakers (stay tuned for the lineup!) 
											will begin at 2:30p.m. We will march to City Hall (107 N. Nevada Avenue) at roughly 3p.m., 
											where there will be opportunities to register to vote and get involved in local activist efforts. </br>
											Thank you for your interest! Please help spread the word by sharing this event with your friends.</p>

												<h3> Share Reflections</h3>
												
											</header>
											<p>
											Thanks for being with us on this sometimes rocky, always challenging journey in the struggle for 
											racial justice. Encouraged by the start of the new year, we are stepping back and looking at the 
											past year and a half with an eye towards the big questions, and would love to hear your perspective 
											also. With that long-term view in mind, here are the questions we are pondering:</br>
											What have you taken away from the events and community meetings that SURJ has sponsored or hosted?</br>
											What are the current most pressing needs of the community?</br>
											In addition, if you have other thoughts about our activities, mission, and the community, we encourage 
											you to share them with us at cossurj@gmail.com. Thanks! </p>
