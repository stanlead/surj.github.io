												<h2>SURJ Colorado Springs Mission Statement</h2>
											</header>											
											
											<p>SURJ Colorado Springs honors SURJ National's core 
											principles of calling in more white people to be 
											accomplices in the fight for racial justice and holding 
											white people accountable and responsible for dismantling 
											white supremacy and breaking down systems of oppression. 
											Simultaneously, SURJ COS has been a multiracial space 
											since its inception and we want to further embrace and 
											center our community. ALL are welcome that are wanting 
											to show up for racial justice. At its core, SURJ is 
											accountable to people of color (POC)-led activism, 
											initiatives, and calls-to-action and we will maintain this format.</p>

												<h3>Postcard Huddle:  Ending White Supremacy</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Join COS CAN, ESN, SURJ, and the Green Party for an opportunity to come
											together and write to lobby City Council members, asking them fight alongside 
											all of us as we fight against hate groups in the city. The cancellation of the
											VDARE white supremacist conference event at the Broadmoor was an amazing show of
											force from all of you and it was a victory to be sure! But what we need to realize
											is that there are many hate groups just like them who are here, have always been
											here, and are working to tear our communities apart. Those who were at the 
											Charlottesville solidarity rally heard Kevin Mitchell say that we need to stay solid.
											Staying solid means you donâ€™t go back into your comfortable space, it means that you 
											work alongside marginalized groups in your community, and you stand against hate 
											groups. This huddle will be focused on writing our city council members asking them 
											to fight along side all of us as we push these hate groups out of our city. Come to 
											Ivywild School, eat some good food, have some drinks, build community, and most 
											importantly combat hate! As always this event is free and we will provide all 
											supplies for you. Bring some money for food and drink if you so choose. If you are 
											able, stamp donations are greatly appreciated but by no means required.<p>
											
											<p>Date:  Monday, September 11, 2017</br>
											Time:  6pm-9pm</br>
											Location:  Ivywild School, 1604 S Cascade Ave, Colorado Springs, CO 80905</p>

												<h3>Empowerment Solidarity Network Community Workshop</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Building community one concept at a time, come to this event and contribute 
											to a unique learning experience in developing a common understanding of hot button 
											issues with diverse community members in the Colorado Springs area! This event is 
											structured to remain civil while exploring heated topics through multiple cultural, 
											economic, and social lenses. Starting with a film screening of "I Am Not Your Negro"
											this workshop will explore historical issues in the African-American community. 
											Refreshments will be provided, and this event will be family friendly.</p>
											
											
											<p>Date:  Thursday, September 28, 2017</br>
											Time:  5:00-8:30pm</br>
											Location:  21C Library, 1175 Chapel Hills Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80920</p>
											<p>SURJ COS will support this event in lieu of having a separate community meeting in September.</p>
